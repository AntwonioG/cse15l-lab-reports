**Keys Pressed**

`ls` `<enter>` `cd l` `<tab><enter>` `ls` `<enter>` `vim t` `<tab><enter>` `:q` `<enter>` `bash t` `<tab><enter>`

first I ls to check the directory, then I cd into lab 7 using tab because it's the only path starting with l, then I ls to see what there is again, after that i vim into the `test.sh` to see what the script does, test.sh compiles and runs the test files, next i leave with :q because i didnt change anything, then i just run the `test.sh`
